    title: `The HyHu Network is a one of a kind web3 project. \n 
    Our vision is to build the biggest Network of Pay2Play ecosystems in Web3 that all ties back to one NFT collection. \n
    All our ecosystems will be open to the public and revenue generating. This will allow us to create a sustainable and scalable business model which continuously benefits holders of our NFT. \n
    Holders are welcome to also use these ecosystems, but they will benefit from them passively through multiple unique and innovative utilities which reward in-perpetuity. \n
    Running through Network will be the $HyHu token. This has been created to be off chain in order to create a stable price and and also to remove gas fees. These tokens will be transferrable through all ecosystems and the NFT. \n
    Our first ecosystem ‘HyHu Raffles’ will launch the network in Aug/Sept 2022. Open to the public, with multiple raffles each week and completely transparent draw mechanism we are making it possible to win a blue chip NFT for less than the cost of gas! \n
    Like all our future ecosystems, this is an established and successful Web2 business model. The main difference between us and them (other than being Web3 and all our prizes being NFT’s) is that each raffle will consist of multiple prizes. Each Raffle draw will have Tier 1 (Blue Chips), Tier 2 (1-10 ETH valued NFTs) and Tier 3 (exciting projects under 1 ETH) prizes. Tier 3 will also be chosen by our Floor Sweeper and Floor Defender mechanisms! (Join the Discord to find out more) \n
    All NFT’s included in our draws will be purchased and in wallets you’ll be able to view prior to ticket sales going live. \n
    Each Pay2Play Raffle will have between 2500–6000 tickets for sale. Each ticket will cost between 1-3 $HyHu tokens which are accrued by holders and purchased by the public. At present the cost of a $HyHu token should you wish to buy one is 0.007 ETH. \n
    Our plan is to eventually host between 25-75 ETH of public prizes, each week, on each of our ecosystems! As an example of how this ties back to the NFT, 50% of all profits will go to fund free-2-enter Raffles for the Holders to win similar value prizes for free! Another example is being able to utilise our Raffle software in order to secure 150% value for any NFT you own (from any collection!). \n
    The NFT collection will eventually have 10 utilities linked or associated with each of our ecosystems. As the ecosystems in our network grow, so too will the utilities. \n
    The second ecosystem will be ‘HyHu Gaming Tables’. An exciting twist on Poker with prizes and competitions being purely web3/NFT based. \n
    The HyHu Network will consist of; \n 1) 3x Ecosystems. \n -- HyHu Public Raffles \n -- HyHu Gaming Tables. \n -- HyHu Ecosystem 3. \n
    2) NFTs \n -- Hybrid Humans. \n
    3) $HyHu Token \n
